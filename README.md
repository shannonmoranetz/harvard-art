### Project Description
[Click Here](https://www.google.com) to visit the deployed application.

The Harvard Art Museum Collection is an app that allows users to view classic pieces from a historic school. It currently generates images randomly from the Harvard Art Museum API. Users have the ability to click on any image displayed to view a pop-up containing a large-sized image alongside several details. In this view, the user can also open the full-resolution image if so desired.

### Project Development Notes:
This project was assigned as a final exam at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io). It was created with Vue, and assigned under a short time window to test students' ability to learn a new framework quickly while producing a viable and usable application. The project followed a similar protocol to a take-home code challenge often assigned by employers.
